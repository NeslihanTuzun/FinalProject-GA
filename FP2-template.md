# SF-DAT-21 | Final Project, Part 2: Project Design Writeup and Approval Template

Follow this as a guide to completing the project design writeup. The questions for each section are merely there to suggest what the baseline should cover; be sure to use detail as it will make the project much easier to approach as the class moves on.

### Project Problem and Hypothesis

-  Event Recommendation System - I will  predict what events the users will be interested in based on events they’ve responded to in the past, user demographic information, and what events they’ve seen and clicked in an app.
- My project will be a sample recommendation system, using machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Naive Bayes Classification. It will be predicting a binary value.
- The most impact in predicting the value is the Location similarity between user and event.

### Datasets

- Kaggle Event Recommendation Data
File Name	Available Formats
event_attendees.csv	.gz (55.03 mb)
events.csv	.gz (161.46 mb)
user_friends.csv	.gz (148.60 mb)
random_benchmark	.csv (146.91 kb)
users	.csv (2.63 mb)
event_popularity_benchmark	.csv (146.91 kb)
public_leaderboard_solution	.csv (6.46 kb)
test	.csv (574.40 kb)
train	.csv (924.23 kb)
event_popularity_benchmark_private_test_only	.csv (51.51 kb)
- If from an API, include a sample return.  (this is usually included in API documentation!) (if doing this in markdown, use the JavaScript code tag)

### Domain knowledge

- I am interested in the recommendation systems.
- Does it relate or help inform the project in any way? Yes.
- What other research efforts exist?
    - There are sample solutions.

### Project Concerns

- I want to use just one or two datasets for the project I will improve it later. I want to connect the data to app by using Google Maps API. I will get support from my iOS Developer friend to create the app. I may need the help from my instructor to understand the algorithm of recommendation system to designed an interactive app, the possibilities.
- What are the risks to the project?
    - The benefit of the project to understand the design an interactive app with the recommendation system algorithms.
    - No, there are no incorrect data.

### Outcomes

- Outcome will be Item based correlation matrix - User base correlation matrix.
- What gain do you expect from your most important feature on its own? - understanding recommendation systems
- How successful does your project have to be in order to be considered a "success"? If I could have a related Outcome of Item based correlation matrix - User base correlation matrix.
- What will you do if the project is a bust - I am also working on a sample linear regression model based on SFOpen Source Travel Decision Survey Data to predict if travel desicion is related with carpool usage. The data is already cleaned and easy to build a model. I will go with that data if the project is a bust.
